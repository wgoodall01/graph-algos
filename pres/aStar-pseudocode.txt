prev = new map of vertex::vertex
dist_to = new map of vertex::number

Q = [ new priority queue of vertices, containing source
    [ ranked by g(v) + h(v),
    [ where g(v) is dist_to[v],
    [ and h(v) is a heuristic function 

dist_to[source] = 0

while Q is not empty:
  u = next vertex in Q, according to priority rules
  remove u from Q

  for each neighbor v of u:
    new_dist = dist_to[u] + length(u, v) 

	if v is the destination vertex:
	  return our result

    if new_dist < dist_to[v]:
      dist_to[v] = alt
      prev[v] = u

    add v to Q if we haven't seen it yet

the result is (prev, dist_to)
