prev = new map of vertex::vertex
dist_to = new map of vertex::number
Q = new queue of vertices, containing source

dist_to[source] = 0

while Q is not empty:
  u = vertex in Q with smallest dist_to[u]
  remove u from Q

  for each neighbor v of u:
    new_dist = dist_to[u] + length(u, v) 

    if new_dist < dist_to[v]:
      dist_to[v] = alt
      prev[v] = u

    add v to Q if we haven't seen it yet

the result is (prev, dist_to)
